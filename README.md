# First-Year-Project
ITU First Year Project Group 10 

In this project, you will complete tasks similar to data scientists working for a department of transport
or a city government, to inform city leaders about traffic fatalities and injuries, and give insights for
urban transport planning. You will explore the latest data set of all recorded road collisions in Great
Britain in the year 2019 provided by the UK Department of Transport with details about the
circumstances of personal injury.
The major parts of the project are:
- Exploring and transforming the data, making numerical and visual reports
- Connecting data tables (accidents, vehicles, casualties)
- Investigating possible statistical associations by filtering for a variety of attributes
- Visualizing the data on a map
- Involving self-obtained external data sets in the analysis
